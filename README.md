DriverPass Portfolio Reflection – CS 255

Summary

The DriverPass project was a system designed for a client who wanted to help users schedule driving lessons and tests online. The system needed to support login and registration, allow students to select lesson times, and help staff manage lesson bookings. The client wanted something simple, efficient, and user-friendly.

What I Did Well

I think I did a good job clearly outlining the business requirements and translating those into a clean, organized system design. My UML diagrams were easy to follow and showed the steps and logic of the system well.

What I Would Improve

If I could revise one part, I would improve the level of detail in my use case descriptions. Adding more user-specific scenarios would help show exactly how the system handles different situations. This would also help developers and testers better understand the flow.

Understanding the User’s Needs

I focused on user needs by making sure the system design was simple and easy to use. For example, the scheduling flow is clear and allows users to select times, see available instructors, and confirm lessons quickly. It’s important to design with users in mind so that the system is actually helpful and gets used as intended.

My Design Approach

I usually start by understanding the user’s goals and pain points, then mapping out a basic flow. From there, I create diagrams and organize the system in logical steps. In the future, I’ll keep using strategies like breaking down use cases, building activity and sequence diagrams, and getting feedback early in the design process to make sure I’m on the right track.
